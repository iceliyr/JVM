========================

This document describes the privacy implications of using JITWatch to analyse your program code or JIT log files.

============
Talking back
============

JITWatch does not transmit any information about your usage of the program, the log files you load, or any code 
you execute in the sandbox.

=====================
Downloading resources
=====================

The first time you double-click on a bytecode in the TriView screen JITWatch will attempt to download the 
JVM Specification from the https://docs.oracle.com website.

https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/jvms/se7/html/jvms-6.html
https://docs.oracle.com/javase/specs/javaspec.css

These downloads are made over the HTTPS protocol and once successfully downloaded they will be stored in your 
jitwatch folder and will not be downloaded again.

=============
Build systems
=============

If you build JITWatch from source using maven or gradle then those build systems will download various further 
dependencies required to compile, package, test, and execute the build targets.

If you want to build JITWatch without downloading additional build dependencies please use the provided Apache 
Ant build script (build.xml) which uses the local dependencies found in the lib folder.

=======================
Sharing JITWatch output
=======================

JITWatch contains a screenshot feature. If you share screenshots from JITWatch, or snippets of your LogCompilation 
XML or disassembled compiled methods you may divulge information about your program that can be used to reverse 
engineer the source code.

====================
jitwatch.com website
====================

The jitwatch.com website is served over HTTPS using LetsEncrypt SSL certificates. The website does not set any 
cookies and does not use any JavaScript or tracking code such as Google Analytics. Your IP address will be 
recorded in the webserver log files which are kept for up to 30 days for the purpose of diagnosing website errors.
